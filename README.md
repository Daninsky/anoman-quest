### **Answers for the Questions about Experience**

**1.	If you have made a game before, what game are you most proud of developing and why?**
One of my proudest games is actually one of the first actual game projects I have ever done in a team, which is during Game Development course at Universitas Indonesia. The game was my first ever experience making a small scale game in a team (of 6 people). Planning and working together was fun, and we all learned to program a game together. We somehow managed to finish the game, present it well in front of the teaching team, and passed the course with grade A. The final product itself wasn’t much but I am still very proud of it.


**2.	What are the programming languages you can use for developing games?**
I have experience in using C# and GDScript (the native Godot Engine script, works very similarly to Python). I also have experience in using the Graphical User Interface functionality of Java and Python, and have tried making simple clickable games with them, but I’d rather not think about them.


**3.	What are the gaming engines you can use for developing games?**
While I do have a little bit of experience with Unity, I’ve been making most of my game projects using Godot Game Engine. It is an open-source game engine with a powerful community backing it, and is used in a lot of indie game creation. I have also dabbled in RPGMaker but that was before I learned to script and code.


**4.	How do you organize and plan your project work?**
Planning and organizing with the team can sometimes be a challenge. I generally use a teamwork platform such as Slacks or Trello on top of the usual social media for communication (LINE, Whatsapp), but usually the social media platform ends up being more active in the end. I usually keep track of what I need to do in my own notepad documents or some other easy to access file. Another way is if the project is being worked on a repository like Gitlab, we can use the issues functionality to keep track of who is doing what issues, what’s done, and what needs to be done. That is actually how my team and I organized my last project, the “Punakawan Z” game. All the issues were assigned through Gitlab issues and we had routine “daily standup meetings” through Discord.


**5.	How long have you been into game programming?**
Game programming specifically, ever since high school where I tried my hand at some simple RPGMaker scripting. It was exciting to develop a storyline and simple gameplay, though at the time most of the work was done by the RPGMaker engine. I then got more interested in software engineering, and by extension game software development. I took the Computer Science course hoping that what I learn can be useful for developing software in the future, including games.


**6.	What kind of game do you like?**
Personally I enjoy playing any type of game, but more so the ones that are story-driven. For genres, my favorites are mystery games, rhythm games, and card games. My favorite titles include the Ace Attorney series, the Zero Escape series, Project Diva, and Bang Dream. I also like playing the Pokemon Trading Card Game, though not as much as I used to. I also played a lot of mobile gacha games during college because it was easy and accessible to play during campus hours. Other than that I enjoy any multiplayer game where I can hop in and have a blast with friends, such as MOBAs like Dota 2 or the Among Us game by Innersloth which has been recently gaining in popularity.


**7.	Have you published a game before?**
If the definition of publish here is available to play for the public, then technically all of my team projects have been published. Links to my past projects are provided in my CV and portfolio. To specify, there are three exactly: GoCell, my Game Development course final project, available at gamejolt.com; Bedtime Story, my Global Game Jam 2019 project, available at the Global Game Jam website; and Punakawan Z, a joint research project with Faculty of Humanities, published and available to download in the Google Play Store (Indonesia region only).
